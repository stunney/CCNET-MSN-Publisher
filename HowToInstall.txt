Step 1 -- Compile
This is the easy part.   compile using the NAnt script provided, or through Visual Studio .NET

Step 2 -- Copy Generated Assemblies to the CruiseControl.NET runtime folder
The following files should be included:
XihSolutions.DotMSN.dll
ccnet.Publishers.MSN.plugin.dll

***********************
NOTE:  Make SURE you do not overwrite your existing Core and Remote libraries for CruiseControl.NET.
If you have trouble running the Plugin, you may find that you need to update the Assemblies in the lib folder of this
project and recompile to update version properties for this project to work.
***********************

Step 3 -- Update your ccnet.config projects that you wish to have msn publishing for.  There is a
sample project configuration file provided in the test project that you can use as a template.

Remember, you need to have a valid msn messenger passport in order for this plugin to work! :)
